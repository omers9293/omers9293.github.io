            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP11 Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>The “Freedom Project” for SEP11 revolves around creating an application that uses Javascript to perform one/multiple functions with a tool that you learned on your own. The game that I've created helps tackle America's biggest weakness that is not addressed in the classrooms which is students not knowing enough geography. Research has shown that studying geography helps students develop a sense of place and space, and spatial awareness which helps them navigate the world and their place within it. </p>

            <p>The geography game that I have created enables the user to practice their ability to recall countries on the map as much as they would like. I have included markers so the user is aware of all the countries they entered and will not have the ability to zoom in because that defeats the entire purpose of the game.</p>

            <p>I feel like I have grown so much better at presenting in front of a large audience because I didn't feel as nervous this time as I did last year. Part of that was because I listened to Mr Mueller's advice about how "if you fail to plan, you are planning to fail" and so I was very much prepared on what I was going to say. I don't think I stuttered that much because I took quick pauses which enabled me not to use any filler words. I also made sure to make sufficient eye contact with the audience and less on the slides since that would create a much more engaging and interactive presentation. I practiced my presentation to myself and to my younger brother who didn't understand anything that I was saying since he is seven years old. Something that I was proud of is not being that nervous since last year I felt like I was about to die from how nervous and anxious I was.</p>

            <p>I have officially finished my 11th-grade freedom project, including both the presentation and the expo's elevator pitch. I feel very much relieved that I was able to stay productive throughout this year so I wasn't burnt out in the end. I had a lot of fun creating this project throughout the year and I'm glad I picked this topic because it is something I'm genuinely passionate about. I used to suck at geography and wouldn't be able to name out 10 countries and now I can name over 100 in less than 5 minutes. I hope that this project can help at least one other person with their geography skills because being aware of where countries are located is very important in the geopolitical world and understanding why some countries are not very friendly with others.</p>
