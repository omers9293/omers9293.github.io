            <p>This project was assigned in hopes to help us practice our skills in collaboration and linking files. This project was done with another partner which means problems have occured along the way.</p>
            <p>For this project, we were given full freedom on how we wanted to complete this assignment. We were offered to either complete this CYOA project in either markdown or HTML. People who completed this project in HTML were given extra points which is why me and my parter chose HTML over markdown. We had just learned all about collaboration and how merge conflicts rise & how we can solve them. We had also just learned how we to link files which is exactly why this project was assigned. I personally beleive collaboration was a much more difficult task than linking files as we had issues communicating. This issue was solved by me trying to communicate on what to do in person. I would add more files and keep expanding on the project if I had more time.</p>
